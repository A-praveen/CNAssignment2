
A08.  Implement Output Port component of a router architecture with N output lines. It will receive packets from switch fabric and based on msg destination tag,  it will transmit  packets on ports 40000+100*N+X, where X corresponds to last 2 digits of lowest USN number in the team.  For example, if lowest USN is 1KS17CS005 and N=3,then it will transmit data on  Ports number 40005, 40105, 40205. It maintains equal size separate buffer for each input port. The packets are transmitted to switch fabric at a given rate T from all input ports. The message received (using nc) has the  structure: "message data" + ":" + "Output Port number". The process (output port) should display the full message along with time when received or sent.
