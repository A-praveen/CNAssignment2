
Program-8

DESCRIPTION OF THE PROGRAM:

This program uses the python code .
We use a Output port component of a router architecture which will receive the packets from switch fabric and transmit packets on ports  number  depending on the last 2 digits of the lowest usn of the members in the group i.e  [57] when the msg is initialized and the output port numbers are generated using 40000+ 100*N+X formula using n=3 in the loop resulting in 40057,40157,40257.
This maintains a  equal size separate buffer for each input port.
The program is invoked by
./InputPort <N> <P> <B> <PS> <T>
where  N-number of output port lines
            P-base value of output socket port number
	 Ex-40000
            B-buffer size for each output port
            PO-UDP port number on which it will receive packets from switch fabric
            T-Transmit rate of packets on each output port

This program can be runned in netcat(nc) or using Python.

LINK USED TO UNDERSTAND THE CONCEPT:

DIFFICULTY FACED BY THE PROGRAM:
1)socket programming was difficult.And we first tryed using the java program but it didnt work well,so we went on working the code using pyton.
2)The threading concept was difficult but the link described above helped us in completing the program.
